\doxysection{Data Structures}
Here are the data structures with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{structElevator}{Elevator}} \\*Keep track of variables that are important for operating the elevators behaviour in fsm. ~\newline
order\+Array contains the value of all order buttons\+: 1 if a given button has been pressed, 0 if not. ~\newline
First 4 rows corresponds to cabin buttons, 4 last to buttons outside of cabin. ~\newline
First coloumn corresponds to down buttons, second (and last) to up buttons. ~\newline
current\+Obstruction\+Value keep track of value of obstruction button. 1 if pressed, 0 if not. ~\newline
last\+Obstruction\+Value keep track of last value of obstruction button. 1 if pressed, 0 if not. ~\newline
 Used to check if obstruction button recently has changed value. ~\newline
door\+Open 1 if door is open, 0 if not. ~\newline
current\+Floor keep track of which floot the elevator is in. Is set to the floor the elevator last was in, if elevator is between floors. ~\newline
current\+Direction keep track of which direction the elevator is moving; up/down/still. ~\newline
last\+Direction keep track of which direction the elevator last was moving; up/down/still. ~\newline
 Used for state transitions and deciding next moving direction in fsm. ~\newline
}{\pageref{structElevator}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{structFSM}{F\+SM}} \\*Keeps track of which state the elevator currently is in ~\newline
current\+State contains the current state of the elevator }{\pageref{structFSM}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{structTimer}{Timer}} \\*\mbox{\hyperlink{structTimer}{Timer}} variable that keeps track of when the timer started ~\newline
timer holds a given time }{\pageref{structTimer}}{}
